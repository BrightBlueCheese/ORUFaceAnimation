# ORU Face Animation
This code was built based on Vox dataset format .
This code was built on the followings.
- CoquiTTS
- https://github.com/yoyo-nb/Thin-Plate-Spline-Motion-Model
- https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip

# Source Video Guides
- Should take the front face video.
- The code will automatically detect and preprocess the source video. You don't have to worry about the resolution or the size of the video.

# Limitation
- The source image preprocessing stage has not been implemented.
- Should have to prepare the image with vox format for the best performance.

# Addition
- Work through the FaceSyncProto.ipynb file. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RKT-s7H3uMLhQWFSwEVbXrG7r0FZlK8f?usp=sharing) 

- The code already has the source image and video file for the test.
